# Emotion-Caluclator (Updated)
(Refinement in process. Planned completion 11/2020)
An updated personal emotion calculator program created in Python to demonstrate basic knowledge of the Python language. (Created for Python3) 
This code gives users the opportunity to input their emotional level based on a numeric scale, then allow for more users to input their own individual statistics. The program documents this in a series of prompts, and ultimately keeps tract of how many people have been prompted.
